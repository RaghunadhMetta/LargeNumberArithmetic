1) Num.java contains add, subtract, product, power methods and divide, mod, squareRoot and the helper methods for base conversion.


Helper functions:
1. Num(String s) : Converts String to number in desired base.
2. Num(Num num)  : Copy constructor for duplication.
3.leftShift(Num number, int numOfShifts): Performs left shift.
4.halfOf(Num a, Num one): Divides ‘a’ by 2.
5. searchQuotient(…): Searches quotient in the range of dividend.
